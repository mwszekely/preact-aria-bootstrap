This is a library that attempts to provide Bootstrap's structure and CSS in Preact with full WCAG accessability (e.g. event handlers, attributes, roles, etc., along with Bootstrap CSS classes).

The intent is to make it easier to use Bootstrap (with its years of well-tested support and pre-built themes) but with better accessability, and more of it built-in by default.

This code is unlicenced into the public domain. If there's anything you find interesting here just take it.
